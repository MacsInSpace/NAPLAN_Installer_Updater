## üìù Unofficial NAPLAN Installer & Updater

This repository provides an unofficial, cross-platform, solution for **installing and updating** the **NAPLAN Locked-Down Browser (LDB)** on both **Windows** and **MacOS**.<br><br>
I (we) have no official affiliation with Acara, Education Services Australia or any of the developers of the NAPLAN LDB.<br>
Just trying to help my peers save some time in rolling out the LDB to their fleet of devices in a more efficient manner.<br>
Have an idea, issue, or improvement? I'm looking for feedback, contributions, and assistance.<br><br>


[For the iOS install, go here!](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/nap-locked-down-browser/id1086807255)

## üåê Overview
- ‚úÖ **Automates installation, updating, and uninstallation** of NAPLAN LDB.
- ‚è≥ **Scheduled task runs daily** but intelligently adjusts update frequency.
  - ‚ôªÔ∏è **Weekly updates** from **January to April** (preparation & testing period).
  - üåû **Monthly updates** outside of testing windows.
  - ‚ùå **NO updates** during the testing window ~~unless forced~~.
- üîç Automatically obtains official **NAPLAN test dates** from **ACARA**:
   - [NAPLAN Key Dates](https://www.nap.edu.au/naplan/key-dates) (please dont change the format!)
- **Uninstalls any old version first** - as recommended by ACARA.
- ‚úà Installs **directly from ACARA's website**:  
  [Assessform NAPLAN Online](https://www.assessform.edu.au/naplan-online/locked-down-browser)
- Signature and certificate validation checks on msi/pkg (Checksum info would be nice Acara..)
- üìÖ **Supports forced reinstalls** (for scenarios where the version hasn‚Äôt changed but has been updated).
- üîß **Logs locally for troubleshooting**:
  - **MacOS**: `/var/log/naplan_update.log`
  - **Windows**: `C:\Windows\Temp\NaplanScheduledTask.log`
- **‚ùå No third party data transmission, logging(other than locally), or server reliance. (aside from this repo)**
  - Can be edited to run locally with SMB backup.

## üåê Installation Methods
### **Windows (Scheduled Task)**
Run the following command in **PowerShell (RunAs Admin)**:

```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; Invoke-Expression (Invoke-RestMethod -UseBasicParsing -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacsInSpace/NAPLAN_Installer_Updater/main/Windows/bin/NAPLANscheduledtask.ps1")
```

This will:
- Set up a **scheduled task** that manages NAPLAN LDB.
- Ensure **automatic updates** based on the smart scheduling system.
  
To Do:
- Test the icon cache fix. - Try not to have to totally delete the cache.

### **MacOS (Launch Daemon)** - (still testing)
Run the following command in **Terminal**:

```bash
curl -sSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacsInSpace/NAPLAN_Installer_Updater/main/MacOS/InstallLaunchDaemon.sh" | sudo bash
```

This will:
- Install a **launch daemon** to manage NAPLAN LDB updates.
- Ensure updates follow the same smart scheduling logic as Windows.
  
To Do:
- Test the sheduling section.

## ‚ùå Uninstallation
To remove **all** existing versions of NAPLAN LDB and update tasks:

### **Windows (Deep Clean)**
Run the following command in **PowerShell (RunAs Admin)**:
```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; Invoke-Expression (Invoke-RestMethod -UseBasicParsing -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacsInSpace/NAPLAN_Installer_Updater/main/Windows/bin/NAPLANnuke.ps1")
```
This will:
- Completely remove NAPLAN LDB.
- Delete all residual files and registry entries.

### **MacOS (Deep Clean)**
Run the following command in **Terminal**:
```bash
curl -sSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacsInSpace/NAPLAN_Installer_Updater/main/MacOS/NAPLANnuke.sh" | sudo bash
```
This will:
- Uninstall NAPLAN LDB.
- Remove associated configurations and cached data.

## üåü Features
- **Automated install & update** (Windows: Scheduled Task, MacOS: Launch Daemon).
- **Intelligent update frequency** (increases before testing, reduces otherwise).
- **Full uninstall scripts available** (deep clean for problem scenarios).
- **Compatible with both Windows & MacOS environments.**
- **Runs live from GitHub** (or can be modified to run locally).

## üé® Contributing
